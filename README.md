# rust_learning
Learning some Rust using the AOC 2024 puzzles

* Day 1 and 2: Just learning how to get a file in and do anything with Rust
* Day 3: Added in testing in the Rust way. Added a lib file with tests on a part1 and part2 function with the example input. Then piped my individual input to the tested part1 and part2 functions from the main file. Since the VS Code debugger seems... imperfect, I am ending up with a lot of debug prints. Will have to think of a way to deal with that or to better use the debugger
